# Database for Bookstore (Case Study) #

**About this project:**


A case study about designing simple database system for a bookstore. This repository contains ERD design and SQL codes for design of bookstore database system. The main purpose of this system is to build database system for bookstore.



_PS: The code in this repository is part of the work I did when I was studying. This code is a combination of the research results that I did on wesbite stackoverflow and w3shcools._
